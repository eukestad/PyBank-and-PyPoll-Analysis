# PyBank and PyPoll Analysis
## Files in the Repository
The Repository contains two main folders that house the python scripts, resources, and output for each analysis.

* [PyBank](./PyBank) 

* [PyPoll](./PyPoll)

Each folder contains the script, a Resources folder containing the csv file, and an Analysis folder containing the text file that the script produces. The folder also contains a screenshot of the output the user should receive.

## Using the Scripts
Run in your choice of terminal - VS Code, Git Bash, etc. 

## Output
Both scripts will output text files containing results into the Analysis subfolder of the respective project.
